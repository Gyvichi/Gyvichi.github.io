Hello and welcome to my simple website. This is for sharing various informations and having discussions. I am not yet a specialist, so there may be errors in my writings. I welcome any corrections or constructive feedback. These days I am interested in deep learning and cryptography, but still trying to be polymath.

## Discussion

I have an inquiry regarding rating systems. I've hypothesized that ratings should be constructed from comprehensive evaluation functions in order to achieve accuracy in measurement. For instance, there is a significant disparity between winning through tactical play and winning via scholar's mate. Given eval()'s ability to accurately measure every process, would it be reasonable to derive certain metrics such as "rating" from eval()? In the context of chess, factors such as time can be taken into consideration along with the construction of a rating from the eval(). 

Furthermore, how can I generalize this concept? What terms can be associated with the functions rating() and eval()? I am guessing the concept of a value function in DRL or a Q-table.
