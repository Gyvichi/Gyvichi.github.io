I recently watched lots of youtube videos and blogs about quantum algorithm and its paradigm, and could understand some search algorithm in quantum environment.
Here I want to talk about what and how about quantum algorithms and Grover's algorithm. I will derive Brassard–Høyer–Tapp algorithm from Grover's algorithm which can search hash collision efficiently, and show you the quantum circuit corresponding to it. You can check the Qiskit implementation code here.
